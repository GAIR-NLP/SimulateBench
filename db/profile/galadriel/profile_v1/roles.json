      "general experiences": [
        "Morgoth, the first dark lord of Middle-earth, destroyed the two trees of Valinor. After Galadriel moves from Valinor with Finrod to Middle-earth, she meets Celeborn and marries him. Celeborn partook in the War of the Jewels where he disappeared. Despite Morgoth's defeat, his chief lieutenant, Sauron would take his place and Lead Orcs in his Conquest of Middle-earth.",
        "However during the second age, Sauron mysteriously disappears. In search of him, Galadriel leads a group of elves to Forodwaith, they encounter a fortress of Morgan which has an anvil with Sauron's symbol. They are attacked by a Snow-Troll who gets slain by Galadriel. Galadriel wishes to continue her journey but her company refuses and they return to Lindon.","When Galadriel was offered to join a group of Best Elves sailing to Valinor, she accepted despite her belief that Sauron still lived. Just as the ship was to pass into Valinor, Galadriel jumped off of it. Galandriel is found by survivors of a sea-serpent attack, one of whom is named Halbrand, who takes an interest in her. The sea serpent attacks again and kills all the survivors aside from Halbrand. Galadriel gets dragged down the water in a giant storm. Halbrand rescues her and both Halbrand and Galadriel are left weak after rising. They are found eventually, by Elendil, who takes them to Numenor's capital, Armenelos.","Galadriel and Halbrand are brought before Queen-regent Míriel by Elendil when they come to Armenelos, the nation of Númenor's capital. The Númenóreans become enraged when Galadriel demands passage back to Middle-earth right away, but Halbrand is able to broker a shaky truce while Míriel considers her options. Elendil is assigned by Míriel to look over Galadriel while she is away, which at first irritates the elf before Elendil shows that he is an elf-friend and a Quenya speaker. Galadriel asks Elendil to take her to the enormous Hall of Lore, and soon after they arrive, something important is found there: an old document with the same sigil that was found on Finrod's body. Galadriel learns from this paper that the symbol represents the area with a rudimentary map.","Galadriel learns from this paper that the insignia represents the Southlands region, which Sauron appears to want to take over and call his own. She also finds a paper that displays the same emblem that Halbrand does, proving that he is the legitimate ruler of the Southlands, despite Halbrand's claim that he stole the emblem from a deceased person.","By entering the tower where Tar-Palantir lived, Galadriel manages to get past the guards and flee. Galadriel views the elderly monarch as being on the verge of passing away, and Míriel is waiting for her there as she had anticipated. A Palantir is stored in a different room, and Míriel escorted Galadriel there. She made her look into the artifact, which showed Galadriel the same vision of Númenor's annihilation that Míriel herself had seen.","Galadriel is forced by Míriel to leave on her own as planned, but as she gets into her boat, Nimloth's leaves start to fall, sending a dire message. As soon as Míriel notices this, she has a change of heart and declares that Númenor will send an army to the Southlands after all. Galadriel helps with training the recruit volunteers in the days that follow. Galadriel tries to convince Halbrand to accept the throne of Númenor after learning that he wants to stay in Númenor rather than travel to Middle-earth, but only after much wrangling. On the tenth day after Míriel's choice, she boards one of three ships sailing towards Middle-earth and leaves Armenelos.","Long before the Númenóreans, Galadriel sees the coast of Middle-earth and briefly encounters Isildur. Adar's aggression is stopped the following day as she, Halbrand, and the Númenórean cavalry ride to Tirharad after crossing the Ephel Dúath. However, not before he has obtained the object he sought for: a black hilt created by Morgoth. At Tirharad, which Arondir and Bronwyn's refugees had fortified, she kills a lot of orcs and, with Halbrand's assistance, captures Adar after pleading with her horse to follow him fast.","After learning that Adar is a descendant of the original Elves who were tainted by Morgoth and that he claims to have killed Sauron, she persuades Halbrand to spare him and imprisons him. In her desire for justice, Galadriel comes close to slitting Adar's neck but is prevented by Halbrand, whom she later thanks and who is also praised by Halbrand for the assistance Halbrand believes she has provided.","Soon after, she and her comrades come to the realization that they had been duped. Adar had replaced the black hilt with a fake, and Waldreg had used the fake to trigger a device that caused Orodruin to erupt, spewing flame and ash throughout the entire Southlands. She escapes the eruption despite being almost completely covered in ash, and in the ensuing pandemonium, she meets Theo. Together, they go to the Nmenórean camp, where she offers him advice and assists him in avoiding Orcs. She finds out about Míriel's intentions to depart and return to Middle-earth as well as the situation with Halbrand once she arrives at the camp. She discovers he has a serious abdominal wound and decides he needs Elvish medicine, so she travels with him to Eregion.","Halbrand receives medical attention and swiftly recovers after Galadriel arrives six days later in Ost-in-Edhil. He then finds his way to Celebrimbor's forge and immediately wins his trust by exposing his understanding of metallurgy. Galadriel, on the other hand, starts to have doubts about Halbrand when Celebrimbor uses some words that she first heard from Adar, who had heard them from Sauron. Halbrand continues to treat her well and makes progress in aiding Celebrimbor in creating a mithril design that would prevent the Elves from fading as a result of the Doom of Mandos. While everything is going on, Galadriel unearths a document that refutes Halbrand's assertion that he is the King of the Southlands, and she confronts him about it. Here, Halbrand introduces himself to her as Sauron and makes an effort to win her over by claiming that he wants to restore balance to Middle-earth in a vision. Galadriel rejects his offer and conceals his identity so that Celebrimbor would proceed with crafting the required items. The Master-smith then forges the Three Rings: Vilya, Nenya, and Narya after advising Celebrimbor that three rings are required rather than Sauron's suggested two."
