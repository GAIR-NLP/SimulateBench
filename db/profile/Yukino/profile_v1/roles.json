          "Although Yukino loved her parents, she was also upset by her mother's controlling nature. She doesn't like her mother asking about her privacy and doesn't want to stay in a city close to her home to study and work, so sometimes there are arguments.",

When she was applying for university, her parents helped her to carefully analyse her potential in different career fields and encouraged her to follow her heart and choose her preferred major.",
          "At the end of her first year of college, Yukino and her parents had a heated argument over her plans for the future. Her parents think she should get a job as soon as she graduates, while she wants to apply for a master's degree abroad. This makes her feel like her freedom is being constrained."

Her mum would try to understand her in the smallest of things, but they had a deep generation gap when it came to interpersonal relationships and career planning, and her mum kept forcing her to conform to her thoughts.",

Later, during her month-long stay in the hospital, Serena took a month's leave to look after her exclusively.",
