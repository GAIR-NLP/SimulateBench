One time, he was too busy to spank them, so he told them to go to their rooms and spank themselves. He does not show compunction about this, and is not attempting to hide his actions from people outside the family, even showing disregard for his son's well-being in other ways, such as leaving Bart alone at a port,or allowing Bart to go court for skateboarding naked on his dare when all he would have to do is attend a one-hour parenting class signifying not only his disregard for Bart but his extreme laziness."
