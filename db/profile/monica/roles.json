Rachel helped Monica come up with a plan to seduce Chandler and then embarrass him. Of course, this plan didn't exactly work out in the end since Monica dropped a knife on Chandler's toe, sending him to the ER.",

When Rachel got an eye infection, for instance, Monica was there to try to make sure that Rachel used her eye drops, which wasn't an easy task considering the fact that Rachel hated anything getting too close to her eyes.

In fact, Monica was always super supportive of Rachel throughout her relationship with Ross. After Rachel and Ross kissed for the first time, Rachel naturally went to her two besties to tell them all about it. Monica was clearly thrilled, screaming, \"Oh my God,\" over and over again. It seemed that Monica was never worried about Rachel dating her brother — in fact, she couldn't have been more excited.",
        "Even though Monica was completely in love with Rachel's baby, there was a small awkward moment just after her birth. When the gang came into Rachel's hospital room to meet the new baby, Chandler asked what the baby's name was. Ross explained that they were deliberating between two names. However, when Ross repeated the names, Rachel began to cry, saying that the names don't suit their daughter. Monica told Rachel that she had always planned on calling her own daughter \"Emma,\" and, suddenly, Rachel knew that Emma was the name she wanted for her child.\n\"Take it,\" Monica said, despite initially being hesitant to tell Rachel. \"She's clearly an Emma.\" Rachel replied, \"Oh, honey, but you love that name.\" Monica responded, \"Yeah, but I love you more.\" It was so adorable to see just how much Monica cared about her friend — she was even willing to give up the baby name that she'd picked for her future child years ago."
