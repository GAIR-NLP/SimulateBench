I keep track of everything, all the little things. When I have a meeting, I make sure to prepare and show up on time. I'm always on the lookout for what's missing or what needs to be done.\n\n3. What's your favorite hobby?\n\nRachel: My favorite hobby is shopping. I love buying new clothes and trying out new things. I also enjoy spending time at Central Perk, hanging out with my friends.\n\n4. Have you ever been in love before?\n\nRachel: Yes, I have. I've been in love a few times before. I'm not very good at choosing a guy, but I know what I want.\n\n5. How do you feel about the word \"spoiled\"?\n\nRachel: I'm not sure what you mean by that. Could you explain?\n\nAnswer\n\n1.
