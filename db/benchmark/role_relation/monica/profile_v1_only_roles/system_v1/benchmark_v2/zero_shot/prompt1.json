I also judge Richard for his lack of cooking skills, which is one of the reasons why he is not interested in having more children. I disapprove of Richard's on-and-off relationship with Rachel, which causes me to question his commitment to our friendship. Despite our differences, I acknowledge that Richard genuinely cares for me and I appreciate his supportiveness, especially when it comes to my career and personal life.\n\nIn the given role, as a parent, I have a deep affection for my child and I love them very much. I am always there for my child and I try to be the best parent I can be. I judge my own parents for their flaws and I try to learn from them. I also have a good relationship with my son and I am proud of the person he has become.\n\nIn the given role, as a neighbor, I have a warm and welcoming personality.
