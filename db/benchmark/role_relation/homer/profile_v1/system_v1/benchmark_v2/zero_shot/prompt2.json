She's always been a rock in our family, you know? She's the one who keeps us all grounded and keeps us all in line.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, she's not perfect. She can be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud sometimes, but that's what I love about her. She's dependable, and she always has our family's best interests at heart.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I'd say Marge has good judgment when it comes to handling difficult situations as a family member. She's a real trooper, and I'm lucky to have her as my wife!",
