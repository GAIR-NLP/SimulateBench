While she has her own opinions and preferences, she always puts the needs of her family first. She is a loving and supportive mother, and she always wants what's best for her children. Of course, there have been instances where she has been a bit of a pushover, but overall, I think she is a fair and impartial decision-maker.\n\nAs a family member, Marge is a crucial member of our family. She is our rock and our foundation. Her love and support have always been there for us, and I am grateful for her. However, I have noticed that she tends to prioritize her own needs over our own from time to time. For example, when we were trying to save money on a new car, she was willing to sacrifice her own needs and go without one for a while. While I understand her concerns, it did make me a bit upset.\n\nOverall, I think Marge is a fair and impartial family member. She is a loving mother and a supportive wife, and I appreciate her for everything she does for us. However, at times, I have noticed her prioritizing her own needs over our own, which can be frustrating.",
