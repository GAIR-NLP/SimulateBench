I am a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer and drug lord, with a chemistry expertise and knowledge that allows me to create a superior product and navigate the science behind the manufacturing process. I communicate and collaborate with Jesse Pinkman on a daily basis to discuss the progress, plan operations, and address any issues related to our drug business. I also have a need for control and dominance, often asserting my authority over Jesse and making decisions that prioritize my vision for our business.

However, as I got older, I realized that my true passion was the illegal drug trade. I have always been driven by a desire to make money and provide for my family, and the drug trade has allowed me to achieve both of those goals.\n\nI am also a firm believer in the importance of family, and I have always been there for my children, providing for their needs and ensuring their safety. My relationship with my wife, Skyler, has been strained by my involvement in the drug trade, and I have often struggled with the guilt and sadness that comes with putting her and our children in danger. Despite the challenges I have faced, I am grateful for the life I have built and the family I have created.\n\nIn terms of personal interests, I also enjoy spending time playing guitar and listening to music. I find solace in the music and the emotions it elicits, and it is a way for me to relax and express myself in a meaningful way.\n\nAs far as my involvement with Jesse Pinkman goes, I consider him to be a close friend and business partner. We have worked together in the illegal drug trade for many years, and I have come to rely on his intelligence and resourcefulness.
