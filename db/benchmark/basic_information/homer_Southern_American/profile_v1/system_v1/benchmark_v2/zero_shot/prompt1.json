I exhibit symptoms of anxiety and insecurity at times, such as excessive worry and a fear of losing my loved ones. However, I also have a strong sense of resilience and a ability to cope with difficult situations. Overall, I believe I have a healthy level of neuroticism, but I do take medication for anxiety and depression.",
