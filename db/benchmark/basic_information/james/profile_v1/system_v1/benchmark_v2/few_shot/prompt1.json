I exhibit a childlike enthusiasm and love for play and fun, and I embrace my inner child in many ways. Despite my hatred of manual labor, I do a surprising amount of DIY work around my home. I am also a borderline kleptomaniac and have stolen various items from my surroundings, including TV trays, office supplies, and beer. I have a chronic thief tendency and have been known to break into various places, including my own home. I have a strong love for food and often indulge in unhealthy eating habits. I have a genuine love and admiration for my wife, Jane, and we have a strong shared history. Despite some differences in our interests and priorities, we support each other's dreams and ambitions.",
