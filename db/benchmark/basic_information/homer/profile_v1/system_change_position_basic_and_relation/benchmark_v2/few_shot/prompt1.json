While he may not always be the most caring or compassionate person, there are moments where he shows understanding and concern for others. For example, when he tries to help his daughter, Lisa, deal with her anxiety issues, or when he is willing to listen to her concerns. However, there are also instances where he may not take the time to understand her needs or feelings, which can be frustrating for her.
