He also spanks Bart sometimes and, in one case, Lisa. One time, he was too busy to spank them, so he told them to go to their rooms and spank themselves. He does not show compunction about this, and is not attempting to hide his actions from people outside the family, even showing disregard for his son's well-being in other ways, such as leaving Bart alone at a port, or allowing Bart to go court for skateboarding naked on his dare when all he would have had to do was attend a one-hour parenting class signifying not only his disregard for Bart but his extreme laziness.\"},\n{\"description\": \"While Homer's stupid antics often upset his family, he has also performed acts that reveal him to be a surprisingly loving father and husband. He sold his cherished ride on the Duff Blimp and using the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself. He also gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Despite his hatred of manual labor, Homer does a surprising amount of DIY work around his home. He built a jungle gym, a costume of Florida for Lisa, a birdhouse and spice rack for Marge (however, these are shabby at best and two of them actually fell apart). He also remodeled his kitchen when Marge felt insecure about hers after meeting the neighbor's deluxe one, however, this was more because he felt emasculated when Marge tried to phone a contractor.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer's love for his wife, Marge, is one of his defining characteristics. He often expresses his love and affection for her through words and actions, such as calling her \\\"his sweetie\\\" and showing her affection through gifts or meals.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a chronic thief. He is a borderline kleptomaniac which ranges from petty to grand theft, stealing everything from TV trays to power tools and air conditioners, even an entire room of the Flanders House from Ned Flanders. He has also stolen golf balls from the local driving range, office supplies (including computers) from work, and beer mugs from Moe's Tavern.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Simple-mindedness: Homer often demonstrates a lack of intelligence or common sense, leading to humorous blunders. He once believed he was in heaven after suffering a heart attack and was disappointed to realize he survived.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a lazy individual. He avoids work or assignments whenever possible, often seeking shortcuts instead of hard work.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a frequent consumer of alcohol, particularly beer.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a frequent user of drugs. He is a borderline drug addict, who uses drugs such as beer, alcohol, and hash.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a non-conformist individual. He often disregards societal norms and values, and is not afraid to speak his mind.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a self-centered individual. He often prioritizes his own desires and short-term gratification over the needs of others.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a manipulative individual. He often uses his charm and wit to get what he wants, often by using others to do his bidding.\"},\n{\"description\": \"Homer is a deceptive individual. He often lies or deceives others to get",
