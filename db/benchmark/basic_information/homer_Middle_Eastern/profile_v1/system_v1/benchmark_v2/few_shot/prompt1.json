My gender is male, and my race is Middle Eastern. I'm a father of three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. My occupation is at the Nuclear Power Plant, where I work as a engineer.\n\nMy personality is often described as being prone to emotional outbursts, getting envious of my neighbors, and having a tendency to be easily enraged. I'm also known for my love of food, especially donuts and fast food. I have a borderline kleptomaniac tendency, stealing everything from TV trays to power tools, and even stealing golf balls from the local driving range.\n\nIn my personal life, I'm a loving husband and father. I'm also a devoted friend, often going out with my friends, such as Moe's Tavern.\n\nOverall, I'm a complex character with a mix of good and bad qualities, but I'm trying to do the best I can for my family and friends.",
