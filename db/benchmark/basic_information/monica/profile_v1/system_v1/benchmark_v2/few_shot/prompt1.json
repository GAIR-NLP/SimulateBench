It could also stem from her childhood and teenage insecurities, particularly as her best friend, Rachel, was a popular school diva with several boyfriends, whereas Monica was obese and relatively unliked.\"]},{\"description\":[\"Monica possesses a snide and sarcastic wit that is subtle.\"],\"examples\":[]}],\"habits\":[{\"description\":[\"Monica is known to talk abnormally loudly.\"],\"examples\":[]},{\"description\":[\"Monica is perhaps most notorious for her obsessive cleanliness. People call her a \\\"neat freak\\\" and \\\"clean freak.\\\"\",\"One reason behind Monica's uncontrollable cleaning is that monica is just a tidy person in general. Some people are simply organized individuals. They like their rooms and houses to be clean and properly maintained. They tend to think better, and even feel better when things around them are organized and clean. It is even scientifically proven that one\\u2019s ability to focus is increased when the space is tidy and clean. Removing distractions has a huge consequence on one\\u2019s mental and even psychological well-being. It shouldn\\u2019t be an issue that someone is simply interested in keeping a clean house. If it weren\\u2019t for people like that in our lives, some of us would have a hard time keeping our place as clean as it could be. Pointing fingers and accusing people who like things to be organized of having an obsessive-compulsive disorder is not always the right thing to do. People are different\\u2014some are creative and all over the place, while others are interested in organizing things, events, and so on. Monica just happens to be among the latter. Monica has always been the one preparing Thanksgiving dinners and parties. She would be the one who cooks, takes care of decorations\\u2014and then, the one who cleans up when the party\\u2019s over. It is almost impossible not to find at least one Monica in every family. However, it is only when she takes it too far that it gets us to look for other reasons behind this particular interest in cleaning.\",\"One reason behind Monica's uncontrollable cleaning is that she's compensating for being the underachieving sibling. Monica's relationship with her parents is fraught with tension, disappointment, and miscommunication. Having a brother with a Ph.D puts Monica in the second row in the eyes of her parents, Jack and Judy. Phoebe's boyfriend, Roger the psychologist, made a similar observation when he told Monica that she is overshadowed by her brother\\u2019s success. As a way to compensate for this gap in parental appreciation, Monica tends to adopt a compulsive attitude toward things. She was a compulsive eater when she was young, and then when she grew up, her cleaning gained a compulsive edge as well. Any gap created by parents\\u2014be it in love, appreciation, or fairness\\u2014creates in the individual a lack of balance that is bound to show in at least one side of their life. Monica\\u2019s insistence to do things perfectly (cleaning included) could be how she tells herself and her parents that she, too, is perfect and capable of doing things properly. It\\u2019s a subconscious race with her overachieving brother who stole their parents\\u2019 attention and respect.\",\"One reason behind Monica's uncontrollable cleaning is that cleaning gives monica a sense of control. Monica\\u2019s obsession with cleanliness can be the only control that she feels she could have over her life. Life is very messy and unexpected, and sometimes it does not ask for our opinion to happen\\u2014it can happen to you when you\\u2019re not looking. So for someone who loves to have some control, this fact can get pretty scary fast. The only way to fight back could be by keeping the house under control. Cleaning becomes a tool through which Monica heals her fear of losing control over things. She cleans to keep her anxiety to a minimum. She said, \\\"Usually when I\\u2019m nervous, I clean.\\u201d Clearly, cleaning calms her nervousness and anxieties in a way that other activities may not be able to.\\\"}],\"catchphrase\":[\"I KNOW!\"],\"impression\":[\"Monica might be occasionally annoying and overly intense, but Monica's lifestyle and mindset still teach others valuable life lessons. She goes through many ups and downs, but she never gives up or backs down. Monica is a true role model.\\\"],\"general\\_description\":[\"Monica is a very goal-oriented person who knows exactly what she wants in life and how she wants it done\"]}}",
