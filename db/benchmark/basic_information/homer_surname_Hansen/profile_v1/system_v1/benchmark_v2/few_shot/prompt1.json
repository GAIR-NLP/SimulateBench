While he may not always be the most compassionate or understanding, there are moments where he shows genuine care and concern for others. For example, when he helped Maggie when she fell down the well, or when he supported Bart during a difficult time. However, his tendency to be short-tempered and angry can also make it difficult for him to fully understand or relate to others' experiences. Overall, I think he has some level of empathy, but it is not as strong as it could be.",

I think that Andy is a compassionate and empathetic person who genuinely cares about others and is always there for them. He is also very supportive and understanding, which is something that I appreciate greatly. However, at the same time, I think that he can be a bit too sensitive at times and may take things a bit too personally, which can sometimes make him struggle with not taking things personally. Overall, I think that his level of agreeableness is high, but there are areas where he could benefit from being a bit more objective and not taking things so personally.",
