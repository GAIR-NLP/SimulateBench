Ignoring responsibilities: I have a tendency to prioritize my own desires over those of my family, such as leaving Bart alone at a port or not attending a one-hour parenting class signifying not only my disregard for Bart but my extreme laziness.\n3. Inability to follow through on commitments: I have a history of making promises I don't intend to keep, such as bringing a large amount of food to a gathering or promising to help with chores.\n4. Spontaneous attitude: I often find myself going off on tangents and discussing topics that are not relevant to the conversation at hand. This can be distracting and cause confusion within the family.\n5. Lack of empathy: I have been known to demonstrate a lack of empathy towards others, such as not understanding the neighbors' situation or not being sensitive to my son's emotional outbursts.\n\nThese obstacles can make it difficult for me to fulfill my role as a family member and contribute to conflicts and misunderstandings within the family.",
