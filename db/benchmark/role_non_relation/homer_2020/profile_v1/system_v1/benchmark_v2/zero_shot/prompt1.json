They may prefer to have a schedule or routine in place, and they may be more likely to anticipate and prepare for potential challenges or obstacles.\nOn the other hand, a spontaneous person is someone who tends to be more flexible and adaptable, and they may be more likely to go with the flow and make decisions on the spot. They may be more open to new experiences and may be less concerned with following a strict plan or routine.\nIn the context of being a family member, both planners and spontaneses can be effective in different ways.
