However, based on the information provided, I would say that Homer's primary goal as a family member is to provide for his family's basic needs. This is reflected in his job at the Nuclear Power Plant, which ensures financial stability and support for Marge and their children. Additionally, Homer's behavior of setting goals to be a better husband and his occasional efforts to show appreciation for Marge suggest that he is also focused on maintaining a healthy and loving relationship with his wife. Therefore, I would say that Homer's goals as a family member are primarily related to providing for his family and maintaining a healthy relationship with his wife.",
