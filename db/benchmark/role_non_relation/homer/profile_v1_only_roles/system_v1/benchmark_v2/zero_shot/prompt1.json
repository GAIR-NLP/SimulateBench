One of the main challenges is finding a balance between work and family life. As a\u6838\u7535 plant worker, I often have to put in long hours at the plant, which can make it difficult to spend time with my family. Additionally, my job can be stressful and demanding at times, which can make it hard to handle any challenges that come with being a family member. Another challenge is making time for my family, especially with my job and other responsibilities. Sometimes it's hard to find the time to do things like go for a walk or have a family activity, which can make me feel like I'm not doing enough for my family. Overall, these challenges can be overwhelming, but I'm trying to work on finding ways to balance my work and family life so that I can be there for my loved ones."
