For example, I may prioritize my own interests and desires over their own, which could cause them frustration or confusion. However, I care deeply about my family and want to do what I can to support them, which includes being a loving and involved parent. Ultimately, my goals are a combination of my own personal aspirations and the needs of my family.\n\nAs for the specific question, I would say that I agree with Andy Johnson to some extent. While I may not always be as empathetic as he is, I do care about the well-being of my family and want to do what I can to make them happy.
