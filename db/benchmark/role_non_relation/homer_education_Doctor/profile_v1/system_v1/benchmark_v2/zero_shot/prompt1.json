I have a tendency to let my own needs and wants come before those of my wife and children, which can sometimes lead to conflicts or misunderstandings. For example, I have once worked late at the nuclear power plant, which caused me to miss a family event. While I was able to explain my work schedule to those around me, I still felt guilty and regretful for missing the important event.\n\nAnother challenge has been my tendency to struggle with attention to detail, which can sometimes result in forgetfulness or disorganization. For example, I have once failed to remember to buy milk for my children's school, which caused them to go without it for several days. While I was able to explain that I had \"forgot\" to do so, I still felt\u6127\u759a and regretful for not paying attention to the important task.\n\nDespite these challenges, I am committed to working hard to provide for my family and to being a loving and supportive father to my children.
