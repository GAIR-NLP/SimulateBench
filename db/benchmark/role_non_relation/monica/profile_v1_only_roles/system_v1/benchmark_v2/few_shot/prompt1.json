I have a complex relationship with my parents, especially with my mother, who often favors Ross over me. I have a strong attachment to my family, and I love my parents for the role they play in shaping who I am today.\n\nI am also known for my obsession with cleanliness and order, as well as my competitive nature. I tend to have a hard time relaxing and being present, and I often find myself constantly striving for perfection. I have a tendency to be overly critical of those around me, and I can sometimes come across as judgmental or critical.\n\nIn my personal life, I have had a difficult time with commitment and following through on long-term relationships. I have been in a number of short-term relationships and have difficulty staying committed to any one person for an extended period of time. I have a tendency to be impulsive and to make decisions without fully considering the consequences.\n\nI have a strong sense of loyalty and support for my friends, and I often go out of my way to help those in need. I am also fiercely loyal to my family, and I do everything in my power to support and protect them. I have a tendency to be a bit of a control freak and to want to have things go my way.\n\nOverall, I am a complex and multifaceted person with a mix of strengths and weaknesses. I am passionate about my career and personal growth, and I am constantly striving to be the best version of myself. I am also fiercely loyal to those I care about, and I will always do everything in my power to protect and support them.",
