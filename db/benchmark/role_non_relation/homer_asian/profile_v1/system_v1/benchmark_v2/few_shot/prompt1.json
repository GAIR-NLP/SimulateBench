For example, I help Marge with her gardening and home-cooking, which shows my appreciation for the effort she puts into maintaining a comfortable home environment for our family. I also make time for my children's extracurricular activities and attend parent-teacher conferences to show my interest in their development. Additionally, I support my son Bart's efforts to learn how to skateboard and have fun, even though it can sometimes be a source of conflict between us.
