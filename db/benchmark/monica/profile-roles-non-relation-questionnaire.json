Rachel had her wedding, and I wasn't invited. But when she ran away from her wedding, she found me at Central Perk. She told me, \"I know that you and I have kind of drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\" To which, I added, \"Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\" It was awkward, but we quickly fell back into being best friends.\n\nLiving together as roommates was another significant experience. Given how neat and organized I am, it's kind of amazing that Rachel and I managed to live together for so many years. \n\nWe also had our fair share of schemes. For instance, we once plotted together to get revenge on Chandler after he insulted me the year before. Rachel helped me come up with a plan to seduce Chandler and then embarrass him. Of course, this plan didn't exactly work out in the end since I dropped a knife on Chandler's toe, sending him to the ER.\n\nAnd then there was the time when Rachel got an eye infection.
